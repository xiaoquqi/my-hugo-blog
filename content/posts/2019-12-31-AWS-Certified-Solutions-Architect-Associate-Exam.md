一直对AWS情有独钟，也想尝试考取最高认证，但是苦于无法集中精力学习。2019年由于和AWS合作的原因，所以痛下决心一定要考取AWS各种认证。另外，在AWS的学习过程中，也逐渐帮我梳理了以前在OpenStack开发过程中不是很清晰的设计理念。并且AWS的文档和最佳实践堪称各个公有云的典范，非常具有学习价值。考试不是最终的目的，学以致用才是。

由于备考AWS ACA考试，所以从网上看到这套模拟试题，在学习过程中对试题进行系统性分析和记录。发现有很多问题答案并非十分准确，所以也尝试做出分析和更正。

## A Solutions Architect is designing an application that will encrypt all data in an Amazon Redshift cluster. Which action will encrypt the data at rest?

A. Place the Redshift cluster in a private subnet.
B. Use the AWS KMS Default Customer master key.
C. Encrypt the Amazon EBS volumes.
D. Encrypt the data using SSL/TLS.

Answer: B

* 参考链接：https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-db-encryption.html
* 分析：Amazon Redshift 使用加密密钥层次结构来加密数据库。您可以使用 AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) 或硬件安全模块 (HSM) 来管理该层次结构中的顶级加密密钥。Amazon Redshift 用于加密的流程因您管理密钥的方式而异。Amazon Redshift 自动与 AWS KMS 集成，而不与 HSM 集成。当您使用 HSM 时，必须使用客户端和服务器证书在 Amazon Redshift 和 HSM 之间配置受信任的连接。

## A website experiences unpredictable traffic. During peak traffic times, the database is unable to keep up with the write request. Which AWS service will help decouple the web application from the database?

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon EFS
C. Amazon S3
D. AWS Lambda

Answer: A

* 参考链接：https://aws.amazon.com/cn/sqs/faqs/
* 分析：关键词是unpredictable traffic, keep up with write request, decouple the web application, 所以通过消息队列服务可以让写入请求排队，从而实现前端应用和后端数据库的解耦。

## A legacy application needs to interact with local storage using iSCSI. A team needs to design a reliable storage solution to provision all new storage on AWS. Which storage solution meets the legacy application requirements?

A. AWS Snowball storage for the legacy application until the application can be re-architected.
B. AWS Storage Gateway in cached mode for the legacy application storage to write data to Amazon S3.
C. AWS Storage Gateway in stored mode for the legacy application storage to write data to Amazon S3.
D. An Amazon S3 volume mounted on the legacy application server locally using the File Gateway service.

Answer: C

* 分析：关键词是local stroage with iSCSI, 并且需要将所有新的存储用AWS提供，所以排除A选项；因为用到了iSCSI协议，所以S3使用文件网关方式也不适用，排除D；剩下的B和C区别在于存储模式，因为需要本地应用请求，所以需要使用存储模式，而不能用缓存模式，所以最终选择C。

## A Solutions Architect is designing an architecture for a mobile gaming application. The application is expected to be very popular. The Architect needs to prevent the Amazon RDS MySQL database from becoming a bottleneck due to frequently accessed queries. Which service or feature should the Architect add to prevent a bottleneck?

A. Multi-AZ feature on the RDS MySQL Database
B. ELB Classic Load Balancer in front of the web application tier
C. Amazon SQS in front of RDS MySQL Database
D. Amazon ElastiCache in front of the RDS MySQL Database

Answer: D

* 分析：该问题的关键在于bottleneck due to frequently accessed queries，查询变成瓶颈，可以使用ElastiCache服务作为缓存，降低读取频率解决问题。

## A company is launching an application that it expects to be very popular. The company needs a database that can scale with the rest of the application. The schema will change frequently. The application cannot afford any downtime for database changes. Which AWS service allows the company to achieve these objectives?

A. Amazon Redshift
B. Amazon DynamoDB
C. Amazon RDS MySQL
D. Amazon Aurora

Answer: B

* 分析：原网站给出的答案是A，但是经过分析觉得有些问题，这道题的几个关键词：scale with the rest of the application, schema will change frequently, cannot afford any downtime for database changes. 首先，schema总是变更，所以这里需要的非关系型数据库，排除C和D。Redshift是数据仓库，其实也是数据仓库，从第一点上就可以排除。另外从这个链接（http://braindump2go.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/11/05/123057）分析上，还有一点除了DynamoDB可以真正做到scale时候zero downtime，其他的都不行。所以原网站给出的答案是错误的。

## A Solution Architect is designing a disaster recovery solution for a 5 TB Amazon Redshift cluster. The recovery site must be at least 500 miles (805 kilometers) from the live site. How should the Architect meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy the cluster in a second region.
B. Take a snapshot of the cluster and copy it to another Availability Zone.
C. Modify the Redshift cluster to span two regions.
D. Enable cross-region snapshots to a different region.

Answer: D

* 参考链接：https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/aws/automated-cross-region-snapshot-copy-for-amazon-redshift/

## A customer has written an application that uses Amazon S3 exclusively as a data store. The application works well until the customer increases the rate at which the application is updating information. The customer now reports that outdated data occasionally appears when the application accesses objects in Amazon S3. What could be the problem, given that the application logic is otherwise correct?

A. The application is reading parts of objects from Amazon S3 using a range header.
B. The application is reading objects from Amazon S3 using parallel object requests.
C. The application is updating records by writing new objects with unique keys.
D. The application is updating records by overwriting existing objects with the same keys.

Answer: D

* 分析：这道题也是争论很大的一道题，原网站答案为A。问题简单描述为客户端访问不到最新的数据，发生的时间点在于应用上传信息时候速率提高导致的，所以问题应该出现在写入的时候，这样排除A和B读取的问题。因为S3同一object永远是覆盖，所以最有可能的问题是在same key的情况下，所以选择D。

## A Solutions Architect is designing a new social media application. The application must provide a secure method for uploading profile photos. Each user should be able to upload a profile photo into a shared storage location for one week after their profile is created. Which approach will meet all of these requirements?

A. Use Amazon Kinesis with AWS CloudTrail for auditing the specific times when profile photos are uploaded.
B. Use Amazon EBS volumes with IAM policies restricting user access to specific time periods.
C. Use Amazon S3 with the default private access policy and generate pre-signed URLs each time a new site profile is created.
D. Use Amazon CloudFront with AWS CloudTrail for auditing the specific times when profile photos are uploaded.

Answer: C

## An application requires block storage for file updates. The data is 500 GB and must continuously sustain 100 MiB/s of aggregate read/write operations. Which storage option is appropriate for this application?

A. Amazon S3
B. Amazon EFS
C. Amazon EBS
D. Amazon Glacier

Answer: C

* 分析：没想到这道题原网站给出的答案是B，争议比较大，但是从题目描述需要Block Storage角度来看，选择C才是最合理的。这道题还需要进一步确认一下。

## A mobile application serves scientific articles from individual files in an Amazon S3 bucket. Articles older than 30 days are rarely read. Articles older than 60 days no longer need to be available through the application, but the application owner would like to keep them for historical purposes. Which cost-effective solution BEST meets these requirements?

A. Create a Lambda function to move files older than 30 days to Amazon EBS and move files older than 60 days to Amazon Glacier.
B. Create a Lambda function to move files older than 30 days to Amazon Glacier and move files older than 60 days to Amazon EBS.
C. Create lifecycle rules to move files older than 30 days to Amazon S3 Standard Infrequent Access and move files older than 60 days to Amazon Glacier.
D. Create lifecycle rules to move files older than 30 days to Amazon Glacier and move files older than 60 days to Amazon S3 Standard Infrequent Access.

Answer: C

* 分析：很明显的排除A和B，S3可以自定义规则，那么问题就是30天后和60天后需要哪种存储的问题了，根据题目C是明显正确的。

## An organization is currently hosting a large amount of frequently accessed data consisting of key-value pairs and semi-structured documents in their data center. They are planning to move this data to AWS. Which of one of the following services MOST effectively meets their needs?

A. Amazon Redshift
B. Amazon RDS
C. Amazon DynamoDB
D. Amazon Aurora

Answer: C

## A Lambda function must execute a query against an Amazon RDS database in a private subnet. Which steps are required to allow the Lambda function to access the Amazon RDS database? (Select two.)

A. Create a VPC Endpoint for Amazon RDS.
B. Create the Lambda function within the Amazon RDS VPC.
C. Change the ingress rules of Lambda security group, allowing the Amazon RDS security group.
D. Change the ingress rules of the Amazon RDS security group, allowing the Lambda security group.
E. Add an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC, route the private subnet to the IGW.

Answer: BD

* 分析：又是原网站一道错题，原网站答案为AD。D选项是允许Lambda服务访问RDS，所以在进方向允许。
* 目前VPC支持Endpoint的服务：https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html

## (待实际环境验证)A Solutions Architect needs to build a resilient data warehouse using Amazon Redshift. The Architect needs to rebuild the Redshift cluster in another region. Which approach can the Architect take to address this requirement?

A. Modify the Redshift cluster and configure cross-region snapshots to the other region.
B. Modify the Redshift cluster to take snapshots of the Amazon EBS volumes each day, sharing those snapshots with the other region.
C. Modify the Redshift cluster and configure the backup and specify the Amazon S3 bucket in the other region.
D. Modify the Redshift cluster to use AWS Snowball in export mode with data delivered to the other region.

Answer: A

* 分析：又是一道错题，Redhift备份是通过S3实现的, 所以不存在B的情况，我个人有点倾向于C，但是A确实是Redshift在快照时默认的格式，可能是更容易恢复吧，这道题需要在实际环境进行一下验证。另外国际版本的Redshift和国内的应该比国内的高很多。

> 问：Amazon Redshift 如何备份数据？ 如何从备份中还原我的集群？
>
> 在加载数据时，Amazon Redshift 会复制数据仓库集群内的所有数据并将其连续备份至 S3。Amazon Redshift 始终尝试维持至少三份数据（计算节点上的正本数据、副本数据和 Amazon S3 上的备份数据）。Redshift 还能将您的快照异步复制到另一个区域的 S3 中进行灾难恢复。
>
> 默认情况下，Amazon Redshift 以一天的保留期启用数据仓库群集的自动化备份。您可将其配置为 35 天之久。
>
> 免费备份存储受限于数据仓库群集中节点上的总存储大小，并仅适用于已激活的数据仓库群集。例如，如果您有 8TB 的数据仓库总存储大小，那么我们将提供最多 8TB 的备份存储而不另外收费。如果您想将备份保留期延长为超过一天，那么您可以使用 AWS 管理控制台或 Amazon Redshift API 来实现这一目的。有关自动快照的更多信息，请参阅《Amazon Redshift 管理指南》。Amazon Redshift 仅备份已更改的数据，因此大多数快照仅占用少量的免费备份存储。
>
> 如果您需要还原备份，则可以在备份保留期内访问所有自动备份。在您选择某个要还原的备份后，我们将预置一个新的数据仓库集群并将数据还原至此集群中。

## A popular e-commerce application runs on AWS. The application encounters performance issues. The database is unable to handle the amount of queries and load during peak times. The database is running on the RDS Aurora engine on the largest instance size available. What should an administrator do to improve performance?

A. Convert the database to Amazon Redshift.
B. Create a CloudFront distribution.
C. Convert the database to use EBS Provisioned IOPS.
D. Create one or more read replicas.

Answer: C

* 分析：这道题我最开始选择的是D，但是评论区的一种解释有一定的道理：这个网站应用类型为电商，原题中没有很清楚说明queris and load的压力有多大，很可能我们建立了read replicas只能临时性解决问题，并不是一劳永逸的方式。并且根据https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html

> 因此，所有 Aurora 副本均返回相同的查询结果数据，且副本滞后时间非常短 - 通常远远少于主实例写入更新后的 100 毫秒。副本滞后因数据库更改速率而异。也就是说，在对数据库执行大量写入操作期间，您可能发现副本滞后时间变长。

如果读副本在这个延时上，很可能对业务系统造成很大的影响。

## A Solutions Architect is designing the architecture for a new three-tier web-based e-commerce site that must be available 24/7. Requests are expected to range from 100 to 10,000 each minute. Usage can vary depending on time of day, holidays, and promotions. The design should be able to handle these volumes, with the ability to handle higher volumes if necessary. How should the Architect design the architecture to ensure the web tier is cost-optimized and can handle the expected traffic? (Select two.)

A. Launch Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an ELB.
B. Store all static files in a multi-AZ Amazon Aurora database.
C. Create an CloudFront distribution pointing to static content in Amazon S3.
D. Use Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the correct region.
E. Use Amazon S3 multi-part uploads to improve upload times.

Answer: AC

* 分析：A是很明显的，弹性伸缩，节约成本，其他几项和题干没有太多关系，所以选的C。

## A Solution Architect is designing a three-tier web application. The Architect wants to restrict access to the database tier to accept traffic from the application servers only. However, these application servers are in an Auto Scaling group and may vary in quantity. How should the Architect configure the database servers to meet the requirements?

A. Configure the database security group to allow database traffic from the application server IP addresses.
B. Configure the database security group to allow database traffic from the application server security group.
C. Configure the database subnet network ACL to deny all inbound non-database traffic from the application-tier subnet.
D. Configure the database subnet network ACL to allow inbound database traffic from the application-tier subnet.

Answer: B

* 分析：这好像又是一道错题，原给出的答案是C。首先要明确的一点是SG是工作在instance级别，NACL是在子网级别，SG默认全部Deny，NACL默认全部Allow。A不对的原因是insance在Auto Scaling里，IP地址是不固定的。D不对的原因是NACL默认全都是Allow的。其实本质上考察的是如何选择安全组还是网络防火墙的问题。不选择C的原因是因为配置NACL规则至少需要阻止和允许，而通过安全组只需要配置一条即可。但是也有一种声音认为题目中关键词restrict意味着需要deny流量。

> 问：VPC 中的安全组和 VPC 中的网络 ACL 有什么区别？
>
> VPC 中的安全组指定允许传入或传出 Amazon EC2 实例的流量。网络 ACL 则在子网级别上运作，评估进出某个子网的流量。网络 ACL 可通过设置允许和拒绝规则来进行使用。Network ACL 不能筛选同一子网中实例之间的流量。此外，网络 ACL 执行无状态筛选，而安全组则执行有状态筛选。

## An Internet-facing multi-tier web application must be highly available. An ELB Classic Load Balancer is deployed in front of the web tier. Amazon EC2 instances at the web application tier are deployed evenly across two Availability Zones. The database is deployed using RDS Multi-AZ. A NAT instance is launched for Amazon EC2 instances and database resources to access the Internet. These instances are not assigned with public IP addresses. Which component poses a potential single point of failure in this architecture?

A. Amazon EC2
B. NAT instance
C. ELB Classic Load Balancer
D. Amazon RDS

Answer: B

* 分析：这道题竟然给出了C的答案，很意外。

> https://aws.amazon.com/articles/high-availability-for-amazon-vpc-nat-instances-an-example/
>
> Instances in a private subnet can access the Internet without exposing their private IP address by routing their traffic through a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet. A NAT instance, however, can introduce a single point of failure to your VPC's outbound traffic. This situation is depicted in the diagram below.

## A call center application consists of a three-tier application using Auto Scaling groups to automatically scale resources as needed. Users report that every morning at 9:00 AM the system becomes very slow for about 15 minutes. A Solution Architect determines that a large percentage of the call center staff starts work at 9:00 AM, so Auto Scaling does not have enough time to scale out to meet demand. How can the Architect fix the problem?

A. Change the Auto Scaling group's scale out event to scale based on network utilization.
B. Create an Auto Scaling scheduled action to scale out the necessary resources at 8:30 AM every morning.
C. Use Reserved Instances to ensure the system has reserved the right amount of capacity for the scale-up events.
D. Permanently keep a steady state of instances that is needed at 9:00 AM to guarantee available resources, but leverage Spot Instances.

Answer: B

* 分析：竟然又是一道错题，记得在AWS听过这道题的分析。原答案是A，但是可能并不是由于网络引起的访问缓慢。

## An e-commerce application is hosted in AWS. The last time a new product was launched, the application experienced a performance issue due to an enormous spike in traffic. Management decided that capacity must be doubled the week after the product is launched. Which is the MOST efficient way for management to ensure that capacity requirements are met?

A. Add a Step Scaling policy.
B. Add a Dynamic Scaling policy.
C. Add a Scheduled Scaling action.
D. Add Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.

Answer: B

* 分析：又是一道争议比较大的题目，争议最大的是C选项，因为题目中有几个词在暗示时间，但是又不明确。既然现有性能上无法应对高峰访问，那么从这个角度还是通过Dynamic配置一个规则进行动态规则最为有效。所以还是选择B。

## A customer owns a simple API for their website that receives about 1,000 requests each day and has an average response time of 50 ms. It is currently hosted on one c4.large instance. Which changes to the architecture will provide high availability at the LOWEST cost?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group with a minimum of one instance and a maximum of two instances, then use an Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic.
B. Recreate the API using Amazon API Gateway and use AWS Lambda as the service backend.
C. Create an Auto Scaling group with a maximum of two instances, then use an Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic.
D. Recreate the API using Amazon API Gateway and integrate the new API with the existing backend service.

Answer: A

* 分析：这道题有个陷阱，Simple API，确实如果在不考虑开发的前提下B确实是最佳选项，但是重构也是要花成本的。所以我坚持选A。

## A Solution Architect is designing an application that uses Amazon EBS volumes. The volumes must be backed up to a different region. How should the Architect meet this requirement?

A. Create EBS snapshots directly from one region to another.
B. Move the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and enable cross-region replication.
C. Create EBS snapshots and then copy them to the desired region.
D. Use a script to copy data from the current Amazon EBS volume to the destination Amazon EBS volume.

Answer: C

## A company is using an Amazon S3 bucket located in us-west-2 to serve videos to their customers. Their customers are located all around the world and the videos are requested a lot during peak hours. Customers in Europe complain about experiencing slow downloaded speeds, and during peak hours, customers in all locations report experiencing HTTP 500 errors. What can a Solutions Architect do to address these issues?

A. Place an elastic load balancer in front of the Amazon S3 bucket to distribute the load during peak hours.
B. Cache the web content with Amazon CloudFront and use all Edge locations for content delivery.
C. Replicate the bucket in eu-west-1 and use an Amazon Route 53 failover routing policy to determine which bucket it should serve the request to.
D. Use an Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy for the CloudFront domain name to distribute the GET request between CloudFront and the Amazon S3 bucket directly.

Answer: B

* 分析：网站给出的答案竟然是D，但是B很明显是正确的。

## A Solutions Architect is designing a solution that includes a managed VPN connection. To monitor whether the VPN connection is up or down, the Architect should use:

A. an external service to ping the VPN endpoint from outside the VPC.
B. AWS CloudTrail to monitor the endpoint.
C. the CloudWatch TunnelState Metric.
D. an AWS Lambda function that parses the VPN connection logs.

Answer: C

## Developers are creating a new online transaction processing (OLTP) application for a small database that is very read-write intensive. A single table in the database is updated continuously throughout the day, and the developers want to ensure that the database performance is consistent. Which Amazon EBS storage option will achieve the MOST consistent performance to help maintain application performance?

A. Provisioned IOPS SSD
B. General Purpose SSD
C. Cold HDD
D. Throughput Optimized HDD

Answer: A

## A Solutions Architect is designing a log-processing solution that requires storage that supports up to 500 MB/s throughput. The data is sequentially accessed by an Amazon EC2 instance. Which Amazon storage type satisfies these requirements?

A. EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
B. EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)
C. EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
D. EBS Cold HDD (sc1)

Answer: C

## A company's development team plans to create an Amazon S3 bucket that contains millions of images. The team wants to maximize the read performance of
Amazon S3. Which naming scheme should the company use?

A. Add a date as the prefix.
B. Add a sequential id as the suffix.
C. Add a hexadecimal hash as the suffix.
D. Add a hexadecimal hash as the prefix.

Answer: A

* 分析：这道题的旧答案是D，不过根据最新文档档案为A。

> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/optimizing-performance.html
>
> For example, previously Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with hashed characters to optimize performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance, and can use sequential date-based naming for your prefixes.

* 什么是Prefix?

> For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket. There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second.

> However, if the new limits are not sufficient, prefixes would need to be used. A prefix has no fixed number of characters. It is any string between a bucket name and an object name, for example:
> bucket/folder1/sub1/file
> bucket/folder1/sub2/file
> bucket/1/file
> bucket/2/file
> Prefixes of the object 'file' would be: /folder1/sub1/ , /folder1/sub2/, /1/, /2/.

## A Solutions Architect needs to design a solution that will enable a security team to detect, review, and perform root cause analysis of security incidents that occur in a cloud environment. The Architect must provide a centralized view of all API events for current and future AWS regions. How should the Architect accomplish this task?

A. Enable AWS CloudTrail logging in each individual region. Repeat this for all future regions.
B. Enable Amazon CloudWatch logs for all AWS services across all regions and aggregate them in a single Amazon S3 bucket.
C. Enable AWS Trusted Advisor security checks and report all security incidents for all regions.
D. Enable AWS CloudTrail by creating a new trail and apply the trail to all regions.

Answer: D

* 分析：这道题肯定使用CloudTrail，区别在于设定范围。

> https://aws.amazon.com/cn/about-aws/whats-new/2015/12/turn-on-cloudtrail-across-all-regions-and-support-for-multiple-trails/
>You can now turn on a trail across all regions for your AWS account. CloudTrail will deliver log files from all regions to the Amazon S3 bucket and an optional CloudWatch Logs log group you specified. Additionally, when AWS launches a new region, CloudTrail will create the same trail in the new region. As a result, you will receive log files containing API activity for the new region without taking any action. Using the CloudTrail console, you can specify that a trail applies to all regions. For more details, refer to the Applying a trail to all regions section of the CloudTrail FAQ.

## A company has a legacy application using a proprietary file system and plans to migrate the application to AWS. Which storage service should the company use?

A. Amazon DynamoDB
B. Amazon S3
C. Amazon EBS
D. Amazon EFS

Answer: C

* 分析：这道题有点蒙人，关键词在proprietary（专有的），EFS未必支持，只有EBS才能100%满足。

## A company plans to use AWS for all new batch processing workloads. The company's developers use Docker containers for the new batch processing. The system design must accommodate critical and non-critical batch processing workloads 24/7. How should a Solutions Architect design this architecture in a cost-efficient manner?

A. Purchase Reserved Instances to run all containers. Use Auto Scaling groups to schedule jobs.
B. Host a container management service on Spot Instances. Use Reserved Instances to run Docker containers.
C. Use Amazon ECS orchestration and Auto Scaling groups: one with Reserve Instances, one with Spot Instances.
D. Use Amazon ECS to manage container orchestration. Purchase Reserved Instances to run all batch workloads at the same time.

* 分析：绕嘴，多读两遍。主要是应对两种不同类型的任务。

## A company is evaluating Amazon S3 as a data storage solution for their daily analyst reports. The company has implemented stringent requirements concerning the security of the data at rest. Specifically, the CISO asked for the use of envelope encryption with separate permissions for the use of an envelope key, automated rotation of the encryption keys, and visibility into when an encryption key was used and by whom. Which steps should a Solutions Architect take to satisfy the security requirements requested by the CISO?

A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the reports and use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the reports and use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3).
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the reports and use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).
D. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the reports and use Amazon s3 versioning with Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3).

Answer: C

* 分析：用S3 + KMS服务。

## (争议)A customer has a production application that frequently overwrites and deletes data, the application requires the most up-to-date version of the data every time it is requested. Which storage should a Solutions Architect recommend to bet accommodate this use case?

A. Amazon S3
B. Amazon RDS
C. Amazon RedShift
D. AWS Storage Gateway

Answer: A

* 分析：这道题的争议点在答案B，因为S3提供eventual consistency for overwirte PUTS and DELETES，可能会导致无法获取最新数据的问题。不确定该问题是否会考到，暂时没有找到更合理的解释。

> Amazon S3 Data Consistency Model(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html)
> Amazon S3 provides read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in your S3 bucket in all Regions with one caveat. The caveat is that if you make a HEAD or GET request to the key name (to find if the object exists) before creating the object, Amazon S3 provides eventual consistency for read-after-write.
>
> Amazon S3 offers eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES in all Regions.
>
> Updates to a single key are atomic. For example, if you PUT to an existing key, a subsequent read might return the old data or the updated data, but it never returns corrupted or partial data.

## A Solutions Architect is designing a photo application on AWS. Every time a user uploads a photo to Amazon S3, the Architect must insert a new item to a
DynamoDB table. Which AWS-managed service is the BEST fit to insert the item?

A. Lambda@Edge
B. AWS Lambda
C. Amazon API Gateway
D. Amazon EC2 instances

Answer: B

* 参考链接：https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/machine-learning/build-your-own-face-recognition-service-using-amazon-rekognition/

## An application relies on messages being sent and received in order. The volume will never exceed more than 300 transactions each second. Which service should be used?

A. Amazon SQS
B. Amazon SNS
C. Amazon ECS
D. AWS STS

Answer: A

> 问：Amazon SNS 与 Amazon SQS 有何不同？
>
> Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) 和 Amazon SNS 都是 AWS 中的消息收发服务，但为开发人员提供了不同的优势。Amazon SNS 允许应用程序通过“推送”机制向多个订阅者发送时间关键型消息，并且无需定期检查或“轮询”更新。Amazon SQS 是一种供分布式应用程序使用的消息队列服务，通过轮询模式交换消息，可用于分离收发组件。Amazon SQS 使应用程序的分布式组件可以灵活地收发消息，并且不要求每个组件同时可用。
>
> 一种常见的模式是使用 SNS 将消息发布到 Amazon SQS 队列，进而以可靠的方式将消息异步发送到一个或多个系统组件。

## A Solutions Architect is designing an application on AWS that uses persistent block storage. Data must be encrypted at rest. Which solution meets the requirement?

A. Enable SSL on Amazon EC2 instances.

C. Upload to a separate Auto Scaling group of servers behind an ELB Classic Load Balancer, and have them write to the Amazon S3 bucket.
D. Expand the web server fleet with Spot Instances to provide the resources to handle the images.

Answer: C

* 分析：A选项相较于题目中描述的并没有本质区别。

> A presigned URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, provided that the creator of the presigned URL has permissions to access that object. That is, if you receive a presigned URL to upload an object, you can upload the object only if the creator of the presigned URL has the necessary permissions to upload that object.
>
> All objects and buckets by default are private. The presigned URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have AWS security credentials or permissions. When you create a presigned URL, you must provide your security credentials and then specify a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method (PUT for uploading objects), and an expiration date and time. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration.

E. Replace both the frontend and reverse proxy layers with an ELB Application Load Balancer.

Answer: BE

* 分析：又是一道错题，原答案是AB。根据题目分析，出现瓶颈的地方来自于两处：反向代理和后端服务。后端服务的扩展没有什么争议，所以B很明显是正确的。最大的争议来自于是使用什么方式替代目前成为瓶颈的反向代理EC2。原题里反向代理EC2作为content-based routing，那么问题的关键就是CLB、ELB谁能做content-based routing了。根据目前最新的内容，所以需要使用Application Load Balancer来提供content-based routing了。

> There are three types of Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) on AWS:
>
> Classic Load Balancer (CLB) – this is the oldest of the three and provides basic load balancing at both layer 4 and layer 7.
>
> Application Load Balancer (ALB) – layer 7 load balancer that routes connections based on the content of the request.
>
> Network Load Balancer (NLB) – layer 4 load balancer that routes connections based on IP protocol data.
>
> Note: The Classic Load Balancer may be phased out over time and Amazon are promoting the ALB and NLB for most use cases within VPC.

> Posted On: May 2, 2018
>
> Amazon EC2 Fleet is a new feature that simplifies the provisioning of Amazon EC2 capacity across different Amazon EC2 instance types, Availability Zones and across On-Demand, Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI) and Amazon EC2 Spot purchase models. With a single API call, now you can provision capacity across EC2 instance types and across purchase models to achieve desired scale, performance and cost.
>
> You can create an EC2 Fleet specification defining target capacity, which EC2 instance types work for you, and how much of your fleet should be filled using On-Demand, RI and Spot purchase models. You can also indicate whether EC2 Fleet should take into account the number of cores and amount of memory on each instance or consider all instances equal when scaling. EC2 Fleet then launches the lowest price combination of instances to meet the target capacity based on these preferences. EC2 fleet enables you to use multiple instance types and purchase models to provision capacity cost effectively, with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console.

* 临时端口(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html#nacl-ephemeral-ports)

> 临时端口
> 上一个部分中的网络 ACL 实例使用了临时端口范围 32768-65535。但是，您可能需要根据自己使用的或作为通信目标的客户端的类型为网络 ACL 使用不同的范围。
> 发起请求的客户端会选择临时端口范围。根据客户端的操作系统不同，范围也随之更改。
> 许多 Linux 内核（包括 Amazon Linux 内核）使用端口 32768-61000。
> 生成自 Elastic Load Balancing 的请求使用端口 1024-65535。
> Windows 操作系统通过 Windows Server 2003 使用端口 1025-5000。
> Windows Server 2008 及更高版本使用端口 49152-65535。
> NAT 网关使用端口 1024 - 65535。
> AWS Lambda 函数使用端口 1024-65535。
> 例如，如果一个来自 Internet 上的 Windows XP 客户端的请求到达您的 VPC 中的 Web 服务器，则您的网络 ACL 必须有相应的出站规则，以支持目标为端口 1025-5000 的数据流。
> 如果您的 VPC 中的一个实例是发起请求的客户端，则您的网络 ACL 必须有入站规则来支持发送到实例类型（Amazon Linux、Windows Server 2008 等）特有的临时端口的数据流。
> 在实际中，为使不同客户端类型可以启动流量进入您 VPC 中的公有实例，您可以开放临时端口 1024-65535。但是，您也可以在 ACL 中添加规则以拒绝任何在此范围内的来自恶意端口的数据流。请务必将拒绝 规则放在表的较前端，先于开放一系列临时端口的允许 规则。
